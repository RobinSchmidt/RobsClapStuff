My goal is to make the process of building a first clap plugin so easy that even someone like me* 
can understand it.

* meaning: someone who is not so savvy with all the infrastructural stuff - APIs, ABIs, entry 
points, exported symbols, wrappers, yadda yadday yah. I've just been using JUCE for so many years 
which allowed me to remain blissfully ignorant of all these "details".
