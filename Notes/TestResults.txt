In this file, I document some results from various kinds of tests like unit tests, performance 
tests, etc.

Performance:

-In the "DSP Performance Graph" in Bitwig (that opens when clicking on the little bluw CPU meter at 
 the top-left of the transport section), I get the following data:

   Block: 480 sample, Samplerate 48000 Hz, Deadline: 10 ms, Load (AVG): ~0.18 ms, 
   Load (MAX): ~0.5 ms, Period jitter: ~10%, Audio Input Latency: 0 samples, 
   Audio Output latency: 480 samples, Timing: Software

-The most relevant ones are:  
 Load (AVG): ~0.18 ms
 Load (MAX): ~0.5  ms

-With 5 instances of StereoGainDemo, I get:
 Load (AVG): ~0.5  ms
 Load (MAX): ~1.5  ms

-When deactivate them all, I get:
 Load (AVG): ~0.18  ms
 Load (MAX): ~0.5  ms

That seems to be rather high performance hit for a simple gain plugin! Am I doing something 
wrong? Try to comment out the code in processBlockStereo...or maybe make a DoNothing/Dummy plugin 
specifically for that purpose. Try overriding process and returning immediately. Maybe the event 
handling and/or error checking takes a lot of CPU?




ToDo:

-Try to tweak the compiler options in Visual Studio to get better performance:
 -The floating point model is set to "precise". Maybe we should set it to "fast". It's under 
  C/C++ -> Code Generation
 -Maybe we should also disable exceptions?
 -Maybe we should enable enhanced instruction sets
 -What about string pooling?
 -In the Optimization page, there's also the "Favor Size Or Speed" field which is set to "Neither".
