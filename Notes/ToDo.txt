Make one .clap with several plugins

-Gain/Utility: StereoGain (-40..+40), Pan (-1..+1), Pos (-1..+1), MidSide (100/0..100/100..0/100), 
 Mono (switch), PanLaw, PosLaw ...check difference between pan and balance

-WaveShaper: Drive, DC, Shape (Clip, SoftClip, Tanh)

-TestTones: Tune, Type (Sine, Saw (Naive), Saw (Clean), Noise, Impulse), Gain. Should respond to 
 midi, i.e. be of the instrument category


Maybe make a file ClapHelpers.h/cpp with helper functions:

-double-to-string conversion
-assertions that trigger debug breaks
-memory leak checks
-amp2db, db2amp, pitch2freq, freq2pitch, lin2lin, lin2exp, ...
