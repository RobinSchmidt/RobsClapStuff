On Windows, the produced .dll file needs to be renamed to .clap and pasted into the folder:

  C:/Program Files/Common Files/CLAP

or into a subfolder thereof (I use RS-MET). Bitwig uses this path by default for scanning for clap 
plugins, so this seems to be the official preferred location. I guess, we can safely assume that 
Bitwig is the best choice for a reference host for testing because the company was one of the two 
main drivers of the development of the clap format (the other one being the plugin manufacturer 
U-He). Bitwig can be made to also scan other locations though. The plugin scanning paths are set up 
via:

  File (top-left) -> Settings -> Locations




To debug it from Visual Studio, we need to attach to to the process
BitwigPluginHost-X64-SSE

Here is some info for how to automatically copy the build result into a specific folder:
